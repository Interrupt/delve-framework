Delve Framework needs to build shaders using the sokol-shdc shader compiler.

Checkout the sokol-tools-bin repo from the below link alongside your delve-framework folder, and you can run a
`zig build shaders` command to build any shaders you have in `assets/shaders`

sokol-tools-bin version: <https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools-bin/tree/466c6dd7906a33ccb7633ab7b03e9e48361be248>
